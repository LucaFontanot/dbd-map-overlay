## Stream Deck Support

The app includes a config generator for [Stream Controller](https://github.com/StreamController/StreamController), allowing you to control maps directly from your Stream Deck.

**Requirements:**
- Linux
- [Stream Controller](https://github.com/StreamController/StreamController)
- Font Awesome plugin installed in Stream Controller (for navigation icons)

**How to use:**
1. Open the app and go to **Settings** â†’ **Stream Deck**
2. Select your Stream Controller installation type:
    - **Flatpak**: Automatically uses the default Flatpak paths
    - **Manual**: Choose your own output directory
3. Click **Create Configs** and select:
    - Number of buttons on your Stream Deck
    - Command prefix (default: `dbd-map-tool`)
    - Map creator whose maps you want to use
4. The app will generate Stream Controller configuration files with:
    - Main pages showing all realms for the selected creator
    - Individual realm pages with all maps
    - Navigation buttons to move between pages
    - Automatic pagination for large collections

**Features:**
- Supports any Stream Deck size (6, 15, 32 buttons, etc.)
- Automatic page navigation with arrow buttons
- Organizes maps by creator and realm
- Uses the command-line interface for seamless integration
- Smart button labeling that splits long map names across multiple lines

The generated configurations will create a hierarchical navigation system where you can browse through realms and select specific maps directly from your Stream Deck.

## Command-line usage
You can start the app with a map command to display a specific map in the **already** running instance.

**Usage:**
```bash
dbd-map-overlay show-map="Creator/Realm/MapName"
```
- If the application is not running yet, it will start normally and not apply the map.
- If the application is already running, the map will be updated in the background.
- If no map is passed and the app is already running, a popup will inform you that it's already open.

- **Map Keys:**
Map keys follow this format:
``
Creator/Realm/MapName
``
Example:
``
SamoelColt/The Macmillan Estate/Suffocation Pit
``
- The key is case-insensitive.
- File extensions are not required.
- If the map name isn't found exactly, the closest match will be used.
