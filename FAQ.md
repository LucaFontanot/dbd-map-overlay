# List of common questions about this app

## Can you get banned for using this app?
No, as stated in the DBD EULA, you can't use any software that interacts, modify or read any aspect of the game, this app doesn't do any of that.  
The app runs on a separate window, requires manual inputs, and does not even know if the game is running or not.  
It is like saying that you can get banned for using Discord while playing DBD.

## Why I can't see the overlay if in FullScreen?
Because, when on FullScreen, the game takes control of the screen and doesn't allow any other app to be on top of it.  
Other apps like Steam and Discord are whitelisted by the game, so they can be on top of the game.
Reminding what is said in the previous question, this app doesn't interact with the game.  
### How to fix
Go to the game graphic settings and set it to "Windowed" or "Windowed Fullscreen"  
By doing this, the game will not take control of the screen and the overlay will be visible.

## The app doesn't work after using a custom image
As stated in this app ToS, the app uses CloudFlare CSAM detection to block any uses of illegal images. This will block the user from using the app.
There will be a manual check of the image, if found to be illegal, the user will be permanently blocked, otherwise you will be unblocked.
